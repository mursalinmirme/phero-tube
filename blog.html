              <hr class="border-b-gray-500 my-5">
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700">Scope basically means where you can use certain variables in your code. When you declare a variable with var outside of a function, it becomes available for use throughout your entire program. Think of it like a universal remote control for your TV. You can change the channel from anywhere in the room.

              Now, a block is like a section of your code enclosed in curly braces {}. Inside these braces, you can declare variables with let. These variables are like special tools that you can only use within that particular function or blcks of code.
              
              Lastly, const variables are like things that never change. When you declare something with const, it's like saying, This is a constant, and I won't change it later. These constant things also follow the same rule as let within blocks they're only available for use inside the block where they are declared.</p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800">The use cases of null and undefined</h2>
              <hr class="border-b-gray-500 my-5">
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700">Null is basically an assignment value given to a variable. The variable which has been assigned as null contains no value.

              When we assign null as a value to any variable, it means that it is empty or blank. It is to show that the variable has no value. Also, null is an object in JavaScript. When it gets assigned to a variable, it represents no value.
              
              As the name suggests, undefined means "not defined". So we declare a variable but do not assign a value to it, the variable becomes undefined.
              
              Unlike null, the value of an undefined variable is set by JavaScript as undefined. The variable gets created at the run-time. When we do not pass an argument for a function parameter, the default value is taken as undefined. Besides, when a function doesn't return a value, it returns undefined.</p>

              <hr class="border-b-gray-500 my-5">
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700">An API, or application programming interface, is a set of rules that define how applications or devices can connect to and communicate with each other. A REST API is an API that conforms to the design principles of the REST, or representational state transfer architectural style.REST APIs communicate via HTTP requests to perform standard database functions like creating, reading, updating, and deleting records (also known as CRUD) within a resource. For example, a REST API would use a GET request to retrieve a record, a POST request to create one, a PUT request to update a record, and a DELETE request to delete one. All HTTP methods can be used in API calls.</p>
